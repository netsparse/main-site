So it's been quite the journey figuring out the ins & outs of writing blog posts in markdown. <!--more--> Coming briefly from writing posts on Wordpress, I wanted to take the challenge in learning how to use Git and how to create a static site.

I had several options I could choose from, and I was deciding between Hugo and Jekyll. I've played with both but decided to stick with Jekyll for now since I had initially set up this site on Jekyll. Though I may plan on moving this blog into Hugo in the future!
